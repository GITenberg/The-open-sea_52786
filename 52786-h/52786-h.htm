<span class="i0">How shall I write this out? I do not write.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talk to you? Yes, and tell of Antony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how I knew him. There at Philippi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I let myself be captured, so to give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time to escape to Brutus&mdash;made pretense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I was Brutus, and so Brutus flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am captured. Antony forgives me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his death I was his faithful friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, after Actium, in Africa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roamed with no companions but us two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our friend Aristocrates, here, myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fed upon his bitter heart. Our guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nods truth to what I say, he knows it all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after certain days in solitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seeks his Cleopatra. As for her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was the sovereign queen of many nations;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet that she might be with her Antony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live with him and enjoy him, did not shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of mistress, and let Fulvia keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wifehood without envy. As for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lover’s soul lives in the loved one’s body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where bode Cleopatra, there his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived only, though his feet of flesh pursued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Parthian, or Cæsar’s hateful heir....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if this Antony would wreathe his spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ivy like a thyrsus; from the chamber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his beloved rush to battle, helmet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smelling of unguents and of Egypt; leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great action and great enterprise to play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the seashore of Canopus with her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fly the combat, not as Paris did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already beaten, with lift sail, desert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victory that was his, yet true it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rank, his eloquence, his liberal blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His interest in all grades and breeds of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pity and his kindness to the sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His generous sympathies, stamped Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A giant in this dusty, roaring place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which we call earth. Who ruined Antony?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, Brutus! For he gave to Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth of which the Queen of Egypt stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As proof in the flesh:&mdash;Beauty and Life. His heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was apt to see her for mad days in Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soul created sateless for the cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ecstasy in living.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">On a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself and Aristocrates and Antony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two companioning him in Africa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering in solitary places, Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brooding on Actium, and the love that kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul with Cleopatra, up he speaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asks us if we knew what Brutus said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While nearing death, to Cassius. “No,” we said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Antony began to tell of Brutus:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How all his life was spent in study, how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He starved his body, slept but briefly, cut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hours of sleep by practice; fixed his thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On virtue and on glory; made himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A zealot of one purpose: liberty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spirit as of a beast that knows one thing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its food and how to get it; over its spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No heaven keeps of changing light; no stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wandering thought; no moons that charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still groves by singing waters, and no suns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of large illumination, showing life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As multiform and fathomless, filled with wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of various truth, each true as other truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was that Brutus, made an asp by thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature, to be used by envious hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed to Cæsar’s breast. So Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discoursed upon our walk, and capped it off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Brutus’ words when dying. They were these:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a>{6}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O virtue, miserable virtue, bawd and cheat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert a bare word and I followed thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if thou hadst been real. But even as evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lust, ignorance, thou wert the plaything too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fortune and of chance.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">So Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consoled himself with Brutus, sighed and lapsed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To silence; thinking, as we deemed, of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what it yet could be, and how ’twould end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how to join his Cleopatra, what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days would hold amid the toppling walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rome in demolition, now the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cæsar rotted, and no longer stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The picks and catapults of an idiot world!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, as it seemed, he would excuse himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Actium and his way in life. For soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He speaks again, of Theophrastus now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lived a hundred years, spent all his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In study and in writing, brought to death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By labor; dying lay encompassed by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two thousand followers, disciples, preachers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what he taught; and dying was penitent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For glory, even as Brutus was penitent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For virtue later. And so Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke Theophrastus’ dying words, and told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Theophrastus by a follower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked for a last commandment, spoke these words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There is none. But ’tis folly to cast away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasure for glory! And no love is worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>{7}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than love of glory. Look upon my life:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its toil and hard denial! To what end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore live happy; study, if you must,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fame and happiness. Life’s vanity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeds its usefulness.”<br /></span>
<span class="i12">So speaking thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wise Theophrastus died.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Now I have said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Brutus ruined Antony. So he did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Antony were ruined&mdash;that’s the question.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Antony hearing Brutus say, “O virtue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miserable virtue, bawd and cheat,” and seeing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eyes of Brutus stare in death, threw over him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scarlet mantle, and took to his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dying words of Brutus.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">It is true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Cicero said Antony as a youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was odious for drinking-bouts, amours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For bacchanals, luxurious life, and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When as triumvir, after Cæsar’s death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kept the house of Pompey, where he lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled up with jugglers, drunkards, flatterers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this before the death of Brutus, or<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His love for Cleopatra. But it’s true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was great Cæsar’s colleague. Cæsar dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Antony is chief ruler of all Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wars in Greece, and Asia. So it’s true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was not wholly given to the cup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>{8}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knew fatigue and battle, hunger too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Living on roots in Parthia. Yet, you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cæsar slaughtered in the capitol,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His friend, almost his god; and Brutus gasping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O miserable virtue”; and the feet of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Syria to Hispania, slipping off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world that broke in pieces, like an island<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falling apart beneath a heaving tide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence from its flocculent fragment wretches leap&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see it was no wonder for this Antony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made what he was by nature and by life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a time and fate of the drifting world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn to Cleopatra, and leave war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rulership to languish.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Thus it was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cæsar is slaughtered, Antony must avenge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The death of Cæsar. Brutus is brought to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dying scoffs at virtue which took off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Brutus’ hand the sovran life of Cæsar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon our Antony must fight against<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The recreant hordes of Asia, finding here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Cleopatra for coadjutor....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s forty-two and ripe. She’s twenty-eight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruit fresh and blushing, most mature and rich;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice an instrument of many strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That yielded laughter, wisdom, folly, song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tales of many lands, in Arabic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hebrew, Syriac and Parthiac.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke the language of the troglodytes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a>{9}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Medes and others. And when Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent for her in Cilicia, she took time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ignored his orders, leisurely at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailed up the Cydnus in a barge whose stern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gilded, and with purple sails. Returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dining invitation with her own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bent his will to hers. He went to her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found a banquet richer than his largess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could give her. For while feasting, branches sunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around them, budding lights in squares and circles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lighted up their heaven, as with stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She found him broad and gross, but joined her taste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him in this. And then their love began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while his Fulvia kept his quarrels alive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With force of arms in Rome on Octavianus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the Parthian threatened Syria,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lets the Queen of Egypt take him off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Alexandria, where he joins with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Inimitable Livers; and in holiday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plays like a boy and riots, while great Brutus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is rotting in the earth for Virtue’s sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Theophrastus for three hundred years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has changed from dust to grass, and grass to dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cleopatra’s kitchen groans with food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eight boars are roasted whole&mdash;though only twelve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these Inimitable Livers, with the Queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Antony are to eat&mdash;that every dish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be served up just roasted to a turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who knows when Marc Antony may sup?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>{10}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps this hour, perhaps another hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps this minute he may call for wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or start to talk with Cleopatra; fish&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fish they did together. On a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fished together, and his luck was ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so he ordered fishermen to dive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put upon his hook fish caught before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cleopatra feigned to be deceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouted out his luck. Next day invited<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Inimitable Livers down to see him fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat she had a diver fix his hook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a salted fish from Pontus. Antony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew up amid their laughter. Then she said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Sweet Antony, leave us poor sovereigns here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pharos and Canopus, to the rod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your game is cities, provinces and kingdoms.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were Antony serious, or disposed to mirth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had some new delight. She diced with him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drank with him, hunted with him. When he went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To exercise in arms, she sat to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night she rambled with him in the streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dressed like a servant-woman, making mischief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At people’s doors. And Antony disguised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got scurvy answers, beatings from the folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tormented in their houses. So it went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Actium. She loved him, let him be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By day nor night alone, at every turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was with him and upon him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>{11}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Well, this life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was neither virtue, glory, fame, nor study,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was life, and life that did not slay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Cæsar for a word like Liberty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it was life, its essence nor changed nor lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Actium, where his soul shot forth to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from a catapult a stone is cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing her lift her sixty sails and fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul lived in her body as ’twere born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A part of her, and whithersoever she went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There followed he. And all their life together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was what it was, a rapture, justified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By its essential honey of realest blossoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of anguished shame. When hauled aboard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship of Cleopatra, he sat down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his two hands covered up his face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brutus had penitence at Philippi<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Remorse and terror there at Actium<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His body not his own, as Brutus’ will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was subject to the magic of a word....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what is Virtue, what is Love? At least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know their dire effects, that both befool,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">The Queen and Antony<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Festival of Flagons, now to keep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To Antony and his honor, if Canidius,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He touched, with Cleopatra, Africa,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Over the land space which divides the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near Egypt from the Red Sea, so to float<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fleet in the Arabian Gulf, and there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A home secure from war and slavery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>{13}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Until he hears all princes and all kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desert him in the realm of Rome; which news<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings gladness to him, for hope put away,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For such he named his dwelling there near Pharos&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The order of Inimitable Livers breaks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ambition, let us say, as if a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were peak and nothing else thrust to the sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a>{20}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By blasting fires of earth, just peak alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No slopes, no valleys, pines, or sunny brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No rivers winding at the base, no fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No songsters, foxes, nothing but the peak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Shakespeare shows the field-mice and the cricket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The louse upon the leaf, all things that live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every mountain which his soaring light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes cognizance; by which I mean to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shows not ambition only, that’s the peak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mice-moods, cricket passions in the man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he can sing, or whine, or growl, or hiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be bird, fox, wolf, be eagle or be snake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so this “Julius Cæsar” paints the mob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stinks and howls, a woman in complaint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most feminine shut from her husband’s secrets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paints envy, paints the demagogue, in brief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paints Cæsar till we lose respect for Cæsar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there he stands in verity, it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tyrant, coward, braggart, aging man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stale voluptuary shoved about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stabbed most righteously by patriots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To avenge the fall of Rome!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Now I have said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to give me warrant to say this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This play of Shakespeare fails, is an abuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the memory of the greatest man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever trod this earth. And Shakespeare failed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By just so much as he might have achieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a>{21}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surpassing triumph had he made the play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cæsar instead of Brutus, had he shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sovereign will and genius struck to earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loss irreparable to Time and ruin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Cæsar’s dreams; struck evilly to death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a mad enthusiast, a brutal stoic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom all gratitude was tricked aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By just a word, the word of Liberty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or might I also say the man had envy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cæsar’s greatness, or might it be true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brutus took edge for hatred with the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Brutus’ sister flamed with love for Cæsar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who was Brutus, by the largest word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes to us that he should be exalted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forefronted in this play, and warrant given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To madmen down the ages to repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This act of Brutus’, con the golden words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Shakespeare as he puts them in his mouth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Not that I loved him less, but loved Rome more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was ambitious so I slew him. Tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his love, joy for his fortune, honor for valor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death for ambition. Would you die all slaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Cæsar might still live, or live free men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Cæsar dead?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Boasting his will, but flagging in the act;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greedy of praise, incautious, unalert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dangers seen of all; a lust incarnate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of power and rulership; a Cæsar smashing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So what was Rome when Cæsar took control?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wealth and power concentered in the few;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A coterie of the rich who lived in splendor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A working class that lived on doles of corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hordes of slaves from Asia, Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23"></a>{23}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who plotted murders in the dark purlieus;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The city ruled by bribery, and corruption;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed gladiators sold their services.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No man of prominence went on the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without his hired gladiators, slaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streets were unpoliced, no fire brigade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe-guarded property. Domestic life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rotten at the heart, and vice was taught.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That Cæsar took; and not the lovely state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ordered and prospered, which ambitious Cæsar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Shakespeare paints him, over-whelmed. For Cæsar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could execute the vision that the people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserve not what they want, but otherwise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What they should want, and in that mind was king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emperor.<br /></span>

<span class="i12">And what was here for Shakespeare<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A swordsman, horseman, and a general<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What could be done and did it&mdash;seized the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rulership and did not put it by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Shakespeare clothes him with pretence of doing.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Egypt, Hispania, after twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a>{25}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cyclic dreams and labor&mdash;king indeed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A name! when sovereign power was nothing new.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That he’s misprized and hated, is compelled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To use whom he distrusts, despises too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, what was life to him with such contempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all this dirty world, this eagle set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid a flock of vultures, cow-birds, bats?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ladder was not lowliness, but genius.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read of his capture in Bithynia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was just a stripling by Cilician<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pirates whom he treated like his slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told them to their face when he was ransomed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d have them crucified. He did it, too.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fitted some ships out, captured every one<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not lowliness his ladder, but the strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That steps on shoulders, fit for steps alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on this top-most rung he did not scan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The base degrees by which he did ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sickened rather at a world whose heights<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unarmed and unprotected to the Senate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing that death is noble, being nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scorning fear. Why, he had lived enough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night before he dined with Lepidus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom he said the death that is not seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not expected, is the best. But look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in this play he’s shown a weak old man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propped up with stays and royal robes, to amble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling and babbling to his coronation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the going, driven by the fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he would be thought coward if he failed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was to think so? Cassius, whom he cowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whipped against strong odds, this Brutus, too,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What Francis Bacon thinks of this.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">My friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing the Rome that Cæsar took, we turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what he did with what he took. This Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Cæsar’s birth was governed by the people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In name alone, in fact the Senate ruled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And money ruled the Senate. Rank and file<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was made of peasants, tradesmen, manumitted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaves and soldiers&mdash;these the populares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who made our Cæsar’s uncle Marius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chief magistrate six times. This was the party<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Cæsar joined and wrought for to the last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fought the aristocracy all his life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart was democratic and his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27"></a>{27}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patrician&mdash;was ambitious from the first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Shakespeare is ambitious, gifted by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muses, must work out his vision or<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rot down with gifts neglected; so this Cæsar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifted to rule must rule&mdash;but what’s the dream?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To use his power for democratic weal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring order, justice in a rotten state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry on the work of Marius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His democratic uncle. Now behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s fifty when he reaches sovereign power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few years are left in which he may achieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His democratic ideas, for he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gain in power, but chance to do his work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfill his genius. Well, he takes the Senate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breaks its aristocracy, then frees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groaning debtors; reduces the congestion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stifled Italy, founds colonies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helps agriculture, executes the laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crime skulks before him, luxury he checks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The franchise is enlarged, he codifies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman laws, and founds a money system;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Collects a library, and takes a census;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reforms the calendar, and thus bestrode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world with work accomplished. Round his legs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All other men must peer; and envy, hatred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were serpents at his heels, whose poison reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart at last. He was the tower of Pharos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lighted all the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28"></a>{28}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Now who was Brutus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cæsar forgave this Brutus seven times seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgave him for Pharsalia, all his acts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of constant opposition. Who was Brutus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A simple, honest soul? A heart of hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bred by his uncle Cato! Was he gentle?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look what he did to Salamis! Besieged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its senate house and starved the senators<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To force compliance with a loan to them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At 48 per cent! This is the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Shakespeare makes to say he’d rather be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A villager than to report himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son of Rome under these hard conditions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Cæsar wrought! Who thought or called them hard?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brutus or Shakespeare? Is it Plutarch, maybe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Shakespeare follows, all against the grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of truth so long revealed?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Do you not see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matter in plenty for our Shakespeare’s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show a sovereign genius and its work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued by mad-dogs, bitten to its death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its plans thrown into chaos? Is there clay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to mould the face of Cæsar; take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What clay remains to mould the face of Brutus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you not see a straining of the stuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making that big and salient which should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little and hidden in a group of figures?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why, I ask? Here is the irony:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29"></a>{29}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakespeare has minted Plutarch, stamped the coin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the face of Brutus. It’s his inner genius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very flavor of his genius’ flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do this thing. Here is a world that’s mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Cæsar mad with power, a Brutus madder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being a dreamer, student, patriot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can’t see things as clearly as the madman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cæsar sees them, Brutus sees through books.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mad-man butchered by a man more mad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father mad before him. Why, it’s true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every one is mad, because the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot be solved. Why are we here and why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This agony of being? Why these tasks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imposed upon us never done, which drive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our souls to desperation. So to print<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tragedy of life, our Shakespeare takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the taking shows he deems the theme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greater than Cæsar’s greatness: human will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dream, a hope, a love, and makes them big.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strains all the clay to that around a form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too weak to hold the moulded stuff in place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus from his genius fashioning the tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human life he passes judgment on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of life. Which could he do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By making Cæsar great, and would it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bitter and so hopeless if he did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So adequate to curse this life of ours?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why make a man as great as Nature can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods will raise a manakin to kill him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a>{30}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over-turn the order that he founds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grape seed strangles Sophocles, a turtle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls from an eagle’s claws on Aeschylos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cracks his shiny pate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">So at the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The question is, is history the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is the Shakespeare genius, which arranges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">History to speak the Shakespeare mood,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Let’s see now what’s her mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This letter to the friends of peace and laws:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O France, thy peace depends upon the laws.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laws! And she hastens to the cutler’s shop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And buys a knife with which to slay Marat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now look! This friend of France’s peace and laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must dodge self-contradiction. How? That’s plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I do not break the law, killing Marat.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why? What’s Marat? A man? Of course, a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then an “out-law,” as she writes. How’s that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlawed by whom? Charlotte Corday of Caen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What else? A man! But then condemned. By whom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The universe.” Voila! The universe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38"></a>{38}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is swallowed by her swollen vanity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She speaks for God, for solar systems, stars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adjudges laws, interprets, executes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is greater than the Revolution, France.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’s a descendant of the great Corneille;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stage imagination, actress, acts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quotes here in this letter from Voltaire’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Mort de César.” Now listen what her hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has used for whetrock, in the words of Brutus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“Whether the world astonished loads my name</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“And deed with horror, admiration, censure,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“I do not care, nor care to live in Time.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“I act indifferent to reproach or glory,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“A free, untrameled patriot am I.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“Duty accomplished I shall rest content.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“Think only, friends, how you may break your chains.”</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Brutus lives in her! And like disease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loosed from the crumbling cerements and dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of broken tombs, the madness which slew Cæsar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infects, makes mad this woman; and she slays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Marat!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">She does not care for the world’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Censure or admiration! Does not care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live in time! She lies! Why, in this room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man, Huer, is sketching her. Behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s drawing now her face for Time to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this letter written to the Committee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She says: “<i>Since I have little time to live,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<i>I trust you will permit me to have painted</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39"></a>{39}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<i>My portrait.</i>” Why? If careless if she live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In memory or time? The secret’s out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And written in her hand: “<i>I want to leave</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<i>A picture for remembrance to my friends.</i>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What friends? Her father? Barbarous? Caen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paris, the whole of France, the world, if Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writes down the people’s friend as beast, would see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face, in such case, which destroyed Marat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemned first by the “universe” and at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By France, the world! What next? She doubts her God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Brutus warrant, “universe” approval,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And writes here as a reason, in addition:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“That as men cherish memory of good men,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“So curiosity”</i>&mdash;see her spirit flop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smile with idiot guilt upon itself&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“So curiosity sometimes seeks out</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>“Memorials of criminals.”</i> That’s her word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Criminals,” and by that word she stands<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Portrayal of her feelings: how she planned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Caen, as ’tis known. She’s being sketched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll sketch her too. You see, she’s strongly built,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large eyes of blue, large features, handsome though;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nose shapely, and good teeth; equipped to play<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She has her schooling in a convent, reads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives with her thoughts and dreams. I’ll sketch her soul:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has not enough of living to consume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forces of her dreams. She reads Rousseau,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Plutarch’s heroes, Brutus most of all.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Who was Marat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of study, learning. Physicist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired of Franklin, Göethe for his works<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On heat and light; a doctor, having won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An honorary title at St. Andrew’s<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Italian, English. Versed in Governments:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You missed it&mdash;case all over! Lincoln’s gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s just had time about to reach the mill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He couldn’t wait until the stage arrived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had business in the courts of Springfield&mdash;well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can believe he has become a lawyer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He borrowed Mentor Graham’s horse to ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Yoakum is in Springfield and to-morrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bring it back.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Who won the case? Why, Abe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He won it by his horse-sense and his wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must have met the jury down the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were they laughing at? About the case.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We started yesterday on the evidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finished up this morning. An appeal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The verdict satisfies both parties, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My judgment stands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Abe is a natural lawyer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows things that can’t be found in books, although<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows the books. And why not? You recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was boarding with me how he studied?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59"></a>{59}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s just four years ago or so, that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came home one night with Blackstone. Well, I’ve noticed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man attracts what’s his, just like a magnet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws bits of steel. You can’t make me believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Blackstone came to him unless ’twas meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he should be a lawyer. Don’t you know?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He read this Blackstone in his store all day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half the night as well. He said to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Volney’s “Ruins,” Shakespeare, Burns, had taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His interest like this Blackstone. Yes, he took it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he went fishing with Jack Kelso, read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let jack row the boat and bait the hooks....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I think he knows this Blackstone all by heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But anyway, he knows the human heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, now here is the case: Here is a colt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">George Cameron says the colt is his&mdash;John Spears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says no, the colt is mine, and Cameron sues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Spears defends, and sixty witnesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come here to testify, on my word it’s true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On my judicial oath it is the fact.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thirty swear the colt is Cameron’s;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thirty swear the colt belongs to Spears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a man impeached, these witnesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are everyone good men, and most of them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know as I know you. Well, what’s to do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scales are balanced. And besides all this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s Cameron who swears the colt is his,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60"></a>{60}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Spears who swears the opposite, and both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are credible, I know them both. So I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit like a fellow trying to decide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What happens when a thing impenetrable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is struck by something irresistible&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m stumped, that’s all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">You see the facts were these:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each of these fellows owns a mare, the mares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look pretty much alike, each had a colt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In April. But the other day one colt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which colt, that is the question&mdash;strayed away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can’t be found. George Cameron has a colt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These men are neighbors&mdash;but John Spears comes over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees the colt at Cameron’s in the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And says, “That is my colt.” “Not on your life,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">George Cameron replies, “The colt is mine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your colt has strayed, not mine.” They come to law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Spears gets Lincoln, and they come to court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sixty witnesses; and here this noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the evidence put in, I sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eye the jury, know the jury’s stumped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I am stumped.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Then Lincoln says: “Your honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s have a trial on view.” I’d heard of that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never sat on such a trial before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Let’s bring the colt, the two mares over here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61"></a>{61}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the jury see which mare the colt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resembles, let the jury use their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As witnesses use theirs.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">That seemed fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so we sent one fellow for the mares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another for the colt. For Lincoln said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Your honor, bring them separate, so the jury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can have the sudden flash of seeing them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Separate, to study them.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">For an hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abe sat here in the shade and told us stories.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pretty soon we heard the horses whinney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the colt. And Lincoln said, “Your honor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s have the mares led past the jury, trotting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s see their pace.” And so they trotted them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Now trot the colt,” said Lincoln&mdash;we did that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jury watched to see the look of legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And movement, if you please, to catch a likeness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nothing came of this. Then Lincoln said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Now turn the colt loose”&mdash;and they turned it loose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It galloped to the mare of Spears and sucked!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, now it’s true a colt’s a silly thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may mistake its mother, but a mare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never let a colt that’s not her own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put under flanks its nose. Of course the jury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all of us know that&mdash;and so did Abe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a>{62}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jury yelled and all the witnesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to whoop. And when I rapped for order<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And got things quiet&mdash;Lincoln rose and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I rest, your honor.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">So I entered judgment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Spears. They went to Berry’s for the drinks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There! hear them laughing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Lincoln took his fee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten dollars, I believe, and went to Springfield.<br /></span>

<p>“Any people anywhere being inclined and having the power have the right
to rise up and shake off the existing government and form a new one that
suits them better. This is a most valuable, a sacred right. A right
which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is this right
confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government
may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can, may
revolutionize, and may make their own of so much of the territory as
they inhabit. More than this, a majority of any portion of such people
may revolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled with, or near
about them, who may oppose their movement. Such minority was precisely
the case of the Tories of our own revolution. It is a quality of
revolutions not to go by old lines, or old laws, but to break up both
and make new ones.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64"></a>{64}</span></p>

<span class="i0">Mother, I’m breathless! I have seen a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strangest man I ever saw. I’m scared!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went down to the hollow, was at play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was marching with my broomstick gun&mdash;and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I stood there and said “attention,” playing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soldier, you know, reciting to my soldiers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a voice&mdash;looked round and saw this man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was enormous with a frightful face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black eyes, black hair, a voice that sounded like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low thunder, though it could be soft and sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said to me, “What’s your name, my boy?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told him. Then he said, “Where is your father?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said, “My father’s gone.” “Where is your mother?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Up at the house,” I answered. Then he asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What are you doing here?” “Why, playing soldier.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Are you a patriot?” And I said yes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh, no,” he said, “your father was an actor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him play the part of Brutus often,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you will be an actor, you’ve the look.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How did he know these things, do you suppose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he said, “Recite for me.” “I can’t,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said to him. “O yes, you can,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a>{65}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You must recite for me.” And I was scared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to cry, and he said, “Hush, my boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not hurt you, but you must recite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want to see what you have memorized.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I was choking, but I tried to do it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The tyrannous and bloody deed is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most arch act of piteous massacre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever yet this land was guilty of.” ...<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“No Richard III,” he said. “Here look at me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you dodge? Why not recite some words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Brutus, for you know them, why, my boy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve heard your father speak the words of Brutus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you hide your knowledge? Look at me!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He terrified me so that I began:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It must be by his death: and for my part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know no personal cause to spurn at him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for the general. He would be crowned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How that might change his nature, there’s the question.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the bright day that brings forth the adder.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I got so far and saw him looking down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he saw&mdash;I don’t know what&mdash;and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stopped and looked&mdash;and there I saw an adder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coiled close to me. I jumped and screamed. He laughed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ran away, and left him standing there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, I am afraid. Who was this man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My head hurts. I’m afraid. Keep close to me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am so frightened.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These crowds that leave the shop and farms, these crowds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solemn and noisy, rapt, tumultuous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sober and drunk, who carry whips and spit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tobacco juice around and drink and eat.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">I have read. I know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never in Rome or Greece were such debates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never in all this world. Look at the theme:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slavery in a republic! As for men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is their equal? Is it Pericles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demosthenes or Cicero, here with us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Webster? And the setting, think of that!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in this western prairie state they pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From town to town, stand up before the mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a>{73}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And battle with their wits&mdash;set falcons loose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of swift and ravenous logic to devour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other’s flights. The crowds perceive the trend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gather enough to guide them and persuade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But much of it is over them. You heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lincoln to-day, when he had subtilized<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The point to deadly ether, say to them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“An audience like this will scarcely see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The force of what I say, but minds well trained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will follow me and see.” That is the point.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of this popular oratory rises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A durable spire of truth. This Lincoln leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great thought and beauty to the race. And yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Douglas will be our senator, and Seward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our President two years from now. As Webster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could never win the prize, this Lincoln too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will fail to win it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Why, you silly fools!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lincoln has sprained his arms and back for good&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he has laid the South out flat and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broken the slavocracy in two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did it with one question; asking that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made the Little Giant cough and stammer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blush his guilt before America.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes, he answered well enough to win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This contest here in Illinois; but look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Southern press is after him already,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They scent the carcass moved, withdrawn a little;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a>{74}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They croak like buzzards&mdash;and there will be war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the eagles and the buzzards now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps when Seward is elected; truly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Lincoln should be chosen, as he won’t.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It isn’t that this Douglas isn’t a master.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is that he is caught between the mill-stones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The upper is this Kansas and Nebraska,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lower is Dred Scott&mdash;and I am glad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did he father Kansas and Nebraska?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why did he flout the ancient ordinance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of 1787, which kept out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This curse of slavery, out of Illinois,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But brought us liberty of press and speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bill of rights? Did Congress have the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass this ordinance of ’87?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or did it lack the power, because the states<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came into the union with their slaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might keep their slaves, reclaim as fugitive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their slaves on freedom’s soil? Well, if it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Congress had the power to plaster down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ordinance of 1787<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this Illinois, this great Northwest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had the power to say the western land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Kansas and Nebraska should be free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As territories ruled from Washington<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no imperialism! So, I say again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It serves this Douglas right to be destroyed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There’s nothing which forbids the Congress acting<br /></span>

<p>“The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in
accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be wrong. God
cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the
present Civil War it is quite possible that God’s purpose is something
different from the purpose of either party; and yet the human
instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adoption to
effect his purpose. I am almost ready to say that this is probably true;
that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his
mere great power on the minds of the now contestants he could have
either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the
contest began. And having begun he could give the final victory to
either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>{118}</span></p>

<span class="i0">Made her a pitiless sovereignty, a force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cold as steel, and dragged her glorious flag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through cruelty, oppression, till its stripes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are bloody gashes on the face of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I have loved that flag! How I have longed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That spoils its glory. As for me, this country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I loved as a lover loves his bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems now a dream! The South has all my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What has it done? Withdrawn, and that alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Union which was formed by states withdrawing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the old confederacy, and leaving states<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out in the cold that did not wish to join.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What has the South done that it might not do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the Declaration? Then to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all these tens of thousands of our kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our blood, our brothers, should be massacred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For loving God and Liberty, serving God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now this day! The South is crushed at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The negroes freed by what?&mdash;by force, by force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which John Brown used, and for the which he paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his damned neck! O Reason! Adelaide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all men I am sanest, they are mad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cannot see these truths: that slavery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sanctioned by the Creator, read St. Paul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men may revolutionize, as matter of right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secede from what they have acceded to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>{138}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not be murdered for it. Do you think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have not measured motives, thoughts? My friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could be happy, if I could forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The duty laid upon me, have the means<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For happiness, so many friends and you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great competence and fame, and greater fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In store for deeper art. So much for this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for the South, as citizens, persons, love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The South is not my friend. Then there’s my mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I adore: See what I sacrifice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fame, money, friends, my mother&mdash;and for what?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it the South, I should not think to act&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is God, is Justice, and I love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, Justice, more than wealth or fame, yes more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than home or mother. All is lost at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The South has been erased and is no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Republic of the North and South is dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gutted by a guerilla. Yes, my country<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Made poets, prophets of us, spurred us on<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And let us live as men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Now it may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A certain Jacob was his grandfather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Matthew says; or it may be that Heli<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his grandfather, as Luke says, but still<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A governor, a shepherd of my people!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look, he’s born in Bethlehem! And why not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hope re-kindled?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">And now look at us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These centuries bruised, imprisoned and made poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem a city of wails and woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole of Israel slaved! And look at him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How does he start his work, whatever it be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By reading from Isaiah at Nazareth:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Well, so it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He preached, was followed by the poor, the weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slaved, despoiled until ’twas noised abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the hill country and in the cities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he stirred up the people everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devising revolution, overthrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cæsar’s rule. But there was murmuring too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some said he was good, and others said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He deceived the people. For upon a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was asked directly of our tribute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to pay to Cæsar, not to pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dodged and said: “Give Cæsar his due and God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His due”; but what we wished to know, was what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Cæsar’s due, and give it him, and if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tribute was his due, but rather casting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yoke of Cæsar, then give Cæsar that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not answer what the Pharisees asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which <i>we</i> wished to hear him answer, though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pharisees had asked him. For we poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enslaved and disinherited had followed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His leadership thus far.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Behold the change:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing from work unfinished he becomes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Son of God and God himself, becomes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mystery, the Word that lived and wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before John who announced him. Tidings preached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grant you, to the poor, but who remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor as before, but worn for broken hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>{197}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of words that changed no thing. And no release<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To captives, and no liberty to those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bruised and in chains. And so I say his work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is left unfinished, nothing done in truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickly, like a sun-rise on the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flashes forth his God-head, and we’re left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Cæsar’s will, and end up with the words:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kingdom is of heaven, not of earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refines the point: this kingdom is within us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will die and rise again from death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascend to heaven, and return again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before this generation passes to take up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own to heaven, and will rule forever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, not in Israel. For the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to be burnt, with all its disbelievers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it’s burnt, sitting at God’s right hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll rule forever with his own! You see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What we expected vanished in such words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such madness, idle dreams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">But, as I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lineage was David’s; Matthew, Mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will tell you so. But David said of Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling him Lord; sit thou on my right hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I make enemies of thine thy foot-stool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How is Christ son of David, being his Lord?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked Jesus of the Pharisees, closed their mouths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With asking that. The common people heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him gladly when he said this&mdash;true enough!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>{198}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, my brothers, did not hear him gladly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if he were the son of God, yet equal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In being and in time with God, why not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son and lord of David? Both perplex<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit of man; one mystery is as dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As another mystery, and if one be so, then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another may be also. Pass the point....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They crucified my brothers with him! Both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Railed on him for deliverance from the cross.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he were God, he could have plucked the nails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let them down, escape. And listen now:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers kept their faith in him to the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since they were condemned and had to pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For insurrection on the cross, chose out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His day of crucifixion for their own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believed that he would save them, and so make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This choosing of his time of penalty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour of luck. And so I tell you truth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though both were railing it was rather pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than lack of hope that made them rail at him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was it mockery that made them rail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hoped to stir him by their words, evoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His greatest strength to help them that they railed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They even smiled a little when the nails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were driven through their hands, as if to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You cannot harm us when this god is here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, do your butcher business, for at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll save himself and us.” And just as men<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>{199}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse to think death near, and still believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will escape it somehow, when no aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But human hands is near, my brothers thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This god would surely save them. So they talked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunched up their legs and shoulders to ease up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strain of hanging on the nails, and waited,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joked with the lookers on, and smiled and begged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweated agony and railed at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the voices in the crowd called out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If you trust God, let God deliver you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you are God’s son, let Him save you now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save thou thyself!” my older brother said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If I were off this cross I’d break your heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You crooked priests, you whited sepulchers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You carrion Scribes and Pharisees.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">And such noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they cast lots to get his garments, shouts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they were won and parted! In a silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked his Father to forgive them, saying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They knew not what they did. My brother bawled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“They know what they are doing, they have killed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prophets in all ages! Don’t say that!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t end up soft, you cursed them hitherto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the vipers that you cursed before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the vultures that you said you’d shut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates of heaven against; these are the wolves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thirst for blood and lap it, unrepentant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blasphemers against you and the Holy Ghost;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>{200}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Committers of unpardonable sins, the band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You drove with knotted cords from out the temple.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what is usury or selling doves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To killing you? Why ask your Father this?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why now this softness? Change of mood, why prayers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of curses? If you’re dying, sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be what you were when you were flush with life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curse them into hell. Hold to your strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curse them into hell.” And so it went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With talking back and forth, mixed in with groans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curses, railings, while my brothers twisted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bodies, and hunched up their thighs and backs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease the strain of hanging on the nails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dribbled at the mouth, and babbled things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed like devils in a soul possessed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when he thirsted and they took a sponge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave him vinegar, and he sucked it in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They looked at him with eyes that bulged with fear:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw him drooping, fainting, losing strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They struggled then and shouted: “Keep on breathing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathe deep! Call on your Father! Don’t give up!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fight for your life, your god-head and ourselves!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By the might of my power and for the honor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my great majesty? Why was it so?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First genius and the dream, then toil and pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While hands lay stone on stone, and as the stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise from the earth, where naked slaves cry out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheel, lift and grunt; and mortar, scaffolding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillars of cedar strewn confusedly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your dream is blurred, even while your city rises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dream. I was like to a woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the pain of travail, who is mad with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce knows her friends or what is being done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>{215}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor needs to know, since nature orders all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delivers her, but lets the mid-wife lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infant to her breast. Even so with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had conceived this Babylon, nourished it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the womb of my genius where it grew, came forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole like a child at last from scaffoldings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion, waste of mortar, stone and bronze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it was accomplished, then my madness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came on me in a moment of clear seeing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this which was within me, was without me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was substance and reality before me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was even myself gone out of me, as the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes from the mother&mdash;then my madness came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not when I saw it first, for I had seen it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both from this roof and from the Hanging Gardens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the temple of Bel, and in the streets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seen it without knowing, as the mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exhausted, dulled with agony may know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child is born, without the consciousness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonder and the rapture of the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the miracle that was of her, but now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a miracle external and a life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauty separate, that walks from her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has its life and way, herself and hers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But different and its own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">And so it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I beheld my Babylon, saw my dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread out before me, clear and definite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauty separate, my very soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216"></a>{216}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torn out of me and fashioned into stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having its life and way, myself and mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet being itself, its own. If I had seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself divided and become two men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My other self come toward me, stand, extend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand to me, my terror were not more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this to see my Babylon. In that moment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My madness came upon me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">But before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some nights and days before this I had lain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In troubled dreams upon my couch, had dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of images and trees, for daily cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of empire and the fears of change and loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had entered in my dreams. Cyaxeres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreamed that a vine grew from his daughter’s womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overshadowed Asia, which denoted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her offspring should be clothed with majesty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rulership of Asia. As for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tree was felled, only the stump was left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound to the earth with brass and iron&mdash;this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold what I am now, as Daniel said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Interpreting my dream. These dreams had come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shook me for the thought of human life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How frail and fleeting! But again to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curses about me for my work and genius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called by these Jews Ha-Rashang; and to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I had chosen Daniel, Hananiah,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Michael, Azariah for mine own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to be taught to help me in the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217"></a>{217}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my administration; even though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I chose all men for duty, wisest use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my great humanity and strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had placed my subjects where they best could serve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty and the progress of my city&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though, as I said, to feel that I had done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things for good and with no thought but good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still to hear these curses and to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worthlessness of human kind, the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bowed my head and prayed to Ishtar saying:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make me an animal and let me feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beasts instead of these: So had I prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my madness in that moment came.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then as to that, my madness: it was sunset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walked upon my palace’s level roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked upon my Babylon; then I thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all my labors, how I had restored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temples of Borsippa, Uruk, Ur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sippar and Larsa, Dilbat; made the plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the great Euphrates rich in corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought plenty to my people, bread and wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all my people; laughter, as it may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between our fated tears to all my people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then I looked on Babylon lying there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the evening’s sunlight, safe behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sixty miles of walls unscalable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising four hundred feet, impregnable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For near a hundred feet of width in stone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a>{218}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw its hundred gates of durable bronze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eyes were lifted to the terraces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up, up above the river to the temple<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Bel who blessed my city, and I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temples built to Nebo, Sin and Nana,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marduk and Shamash, saw my aqueducts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The houses of my people, in between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palm grooves and the gardens bearing food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to feed the city if besieged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the Hanging Gardens which I built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soothe Amytis, who had memories<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mountainous Media, gazing on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Babylonian plains.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">So as I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked upon my city, voices passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below me muttering Ha-Rashang, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Babylon, my Babylon, lay before me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As my genius realized, grown out of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself become another, and a being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once was me, but now no more was me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was mine and was not mine; and with that thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising like Enlil, god of storm and thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my terrored spirit, I grew mad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled among the beasts, where for a season<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ate grass with the oxen, let the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall on my body, till my hairs were grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like eagle’s feathers and my nails were grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like claws of birds. In madness and in hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men and life, in loathing of my glory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219"></a>{219}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My genius and my labors did I live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In loathing of these tribes who hate the mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goddess of our ritual and belief;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of procreative nature, curse the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty, and of love wherewith I built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Babylon of glory, lust of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till nature cured me and I came again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rule my Babylon, my excellence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of majesty returned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">What am I now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed with these eighty years? My Babylon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it now to me? I am a father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose son is aging, even has made his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lived to see it fade, diminish. A son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So old his sonship is a memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has almost ceased to be&mdash;that’s Babylon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, the father, know this Babylon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As creature of my loins, yet indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This city scarcely differs from the cities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lie afar, as aging sons are men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the men of earth, but scarcely more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a father bent with time than other men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in my riotous genius, like a vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did put forth this branch, the vine decays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The branch will live a season. Out of genius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lust of life to madness, out of madness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this tranquillity, and this setting sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This peace with heaven.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hands made to touch, tongues made to taste, minds made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think, imagine, love given to indulge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For rapture. There’s no law of heaven or earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That trims eyes, ears, the senses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of use; but all were made to leaf and bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The idea of the eye, the ear, the hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only reason with regard for health<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of eyes, ears, hands, may guide and say: how far....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See now what Hadrian’s mind created here:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tragic theatre, a comic theatre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a>{241}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What for? For eyes’ sake, for exploring life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Katharsis? Yes. But use? No use to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thinks life sin, the world’s end near, for Jews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who like the frogs in marshes croaking, say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“For our sakes was the world created, we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone are chosen of God.” No use for him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sees enough of suffering in life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without its mimicry; sees not the art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shooting light between the mystery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human fate, and waking sympathy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through understanding. Christian weeds I chop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose roots begin to sap the tragic roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sophocles.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">But I say eyes may see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I wish to watch the lions fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What interdicts me, and what reason for it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now look how Hadrian’s mind puts into flower:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A temple for Greek books, and one for Latin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there’s the stadium, and there’s the baths.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These Christians frown the bath. If I make out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus may come today, and wherefore wash?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides the naked bathers cling and kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the tepidarium at times, and hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out with all bathing!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">There’s the palace too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which o’ertops Nero’s Golden House, they say.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of Hadrian glows amid his friends. What’s best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In life, Aristo? Why, when the soul is freed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From business, traffic, grasping, thought of self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aches of the day, and being freed shines forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As star companions star, in smiles and words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of praise, affection. Hadrian loves the faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of happiness, and lets his guests fare free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wander eight miles of garden, enter vales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Tempe, watch a mimic Peneus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flow by; encounter fauns amid the brakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surprise Bacchantes sleeping; hear from hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A chorus of Euripides soothe their souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dreams before Faustina’s sculptured face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Antinous, Apollo, Venus; bathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their glowing bodies in the pools; partake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of food or wine, gifts of the gods. Such life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is passing, soon will pass. Aurelius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies under thought, which thrived before the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Paul for all of that, the folly sees not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slaving Christians, while himself is teaching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christian doctrine! Ugliness, denial,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not Hadrian’s Villa, but a villa walled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walls spiked and guarded, and a house of walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empty of sculpture, where a miser-man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>{243}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i12">You see, my friend<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For I know what engenders Christian faith:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man dreams he can be saved, but saved from what?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin? What is sin? Age? What can save from age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What keep the spring of youth, its rosy flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its spirit never tiring, hope undarkened,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why nothing! All’s illusion that holds forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A medicine for wrinkles, shrunken arms.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Does Jesus ease a soul’s pain, cure a loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save as these devotees may soothe their hearts<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No! good Aristo, all this Roman realm,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He was stricken with the flu. I telephoned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The officer, who raved and said no trick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would go with him. He’d send for him. He did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293"></a>{293}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took him out with a raging temperature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back to camp. He almost died for that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when he got up, wobbled for some weeks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And about the time he stood up fairly strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shipped him off to Europe; and they went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yelling like tigers smelling blood, and God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed farthest from their thoughts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Well, so it went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after while we had the armistice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war was over, but no letter came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where was he? Dead? We couldn’t learn a thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at last this boy who went to fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God and for democracy landed up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Russia fighting democracy, as America<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fought France in eighteen hundred&mdash;for a letter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to us telling where he was. And there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stayed some months and fought for covenants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived at in the open, independence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of little and big peoples, for the sea’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freedom, or democracy, I’m not sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one of these or all, I am not sure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He got through anyway, or they got through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him, perhaps, for he came back at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One eye out and one leg gone, and he’d lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, so he said, and didn’t use the word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Democracy at all, and, as for war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said to me: “What is it? Everything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has its own idea, and the idea of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294"></a>{294}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is killing people? That’s our job, that’s war!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everybody yells atrocities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everybody does ’em&mdash;what the hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do people think war is, a Sunday School?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want some money, Dad, for I am broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I can’t work at much now, and, by God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I’ll write my story. So they’ll know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They use you, and they fool you, and you die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That some one may make money selling stuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grab off lands or commerce. Hell’s delight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I was sick in Russia, had delusions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a snake so big he wrapped the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swallowed it with everybody in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see, the snake’s the money-men, big business,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The schemers, human buzzards, who eat up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young fellows and the kids, and lay on fat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fresh young blood that wants to shed itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God and truth! I killed a Russian soldier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: ‘You bastard,’ as I stuck him through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hate yourself, so you just kill to glut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hatred of yourself, your cruelty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which lusts, as it can masquerade behind<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
